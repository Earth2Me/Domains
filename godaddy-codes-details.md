# Non-viral codes #

These are the gems of GoDaddy codes, as they have few restrictions and <em>can</em> work for renewals.  The trick is finding one that isn't for new customers/products/registrations only.  <code style="font-weight: bold">BIGWIN30</code> works for renewals until early July 2014, but all of the other good ones seem to have expired.

Codes are ordered by the date they became effective in descending order: newer codes are on top.

# Viral codes #

These codes are marked as `Viral` by GoDaddy.  They tend to have a lot more restrictions than non-viral codes.

# Affiliate codes #

Affiliate codes begin with <code>WOW</code> and only seem to work for new customers.  The account used to generate the code gets a $10 credit when new customers make a purchase with the code, with a few restrictions.  If you want to make a mass-transfer to GoDaddy, these will be handy.
